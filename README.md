// Mini Challenge 2-4:
    2. create an endpoint where the user enters 2 numbers and it outputs the sum.
    3. create and endpoint where the user enters their name and the time they wake up and it outputs a sentence telling you what their name is and what time they woke up.
    4. create an endpoint were the user enters 2 numbers and it outputs whether either number is greater than, less than or equal to each other.

// Peer Reviewer Comments: Everything works, but for the Routes, you put controllers without the square brackets [], which is meant to erase the controllers in the name of the pathway/location. Also, the variables in the Routes should be spaced by / and not by commas.
